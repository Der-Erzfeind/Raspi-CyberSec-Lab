In this situation, an attacker will send out an AE deauthentication flood and bump off clients for a client from a targeted network. When that client attempts to reconnect, the attacker will sniff the traffic that is generated during that connection and try to extract the connection information exchange. This type of attack can also be used to induce a man-in-the-middle situation where the attacker will deauthenticate a victim and then force them to re-authenticate through a rogue access point. They'll then direct the traffic on to an internet connection or whatever the actual legitimate network is.

It provides no clearly-defined method for key distribution (such as centralized key management) other than pre-shared keys, which must be input manually into each station. As a result, the keys are cumbersome to change on a large scale; thus, rarely changed.
Its design makes it possible to passively uncover the key using sniffing tools and cracking tools available freely in operating systems, such as the Linux-based Kali.
Key generators used by different vendors are inconsistently and poorly designed, leading to vulnerabilities such as issues with the use of 40-bit keys.

CRC32 used in integrity checking is flawed, and with slight modifications packets may be modified consistently by an attacker to produce their desired results.

What this means in practice is that if two or more stations happen to transmit at one time they will cause a collision (think of it as two people talking at the same time). This technology will detect the collision and deal with it by forcing both stations to wait a random period of time before retransmitting and hopefully avoiding another collision. Collisions are a normal part of many networks and are not a problem until the collisions get excessive, in which case a network can be segmented to reduce the number to a better number.
In wireless networks, a technique known as CSMA/CA or Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance is used. As you may guess, the process involves not detecting a collision, but rather avoiding a collision altogether. In practice, this means that a station will check to see if anyone is transmitting, and if they are not it will send out a signal saying it is ready to transmit to keep any other station from sending data. At this point, the device will transmit and signal when it is done transmitting so the network is released.",YELLOW,CSMA

As a quick refresher, you should recall that the MAC address, sometimes called the physical address, is a hexadecimal value that is assigned to each and every network card as it's manufactured. Partially due to design and partially due to industry-standard, these addresses are intended to be unique, so that no two network cards should ever have the same MAC address. It is because of this very reason that MAC filtering is able to function as it does. However, by using MAC spoofing, we can change the address that is being reported and therefore put in whatever address we want to have reported from the network adapter. In practice, this means that by changing our MAC address to one of our choosing we can either evade blacklisting by changing our MAC address to something new or we can circumvent whitelisting by using the MAC address of an approved device.",YELLOW,MAC Spoofing

This technique, simply put, is to use a wireless enabled device along with specialized software used to detect or probe wireless networks that have come with in range of the wireless device.

What makes war driving so popular and so effective is the fact that many computer users, both personal and business, have been deploying 802.11 wireless access points for years with little regard for security. The deployment of a wireless network that allows the user to roam has taken precedence over taking measures to secure their access points and devices against potential attack.

In response to this deployment of wireless networks that are misconfigured or insecure, we have a category of attackers that engage in this practice known as war driving. Those who engage in this activity will build custom rigs built out of a combination of hardware and software, with the intent of cruising public venues to find both wireless access points and devices in some cases. These individuals may just be interested in locating and targeting a specific network for their own ends or, in some cases, they may even share this information to an online database or website where any visitor can search for these access points.",YELLOW,Importance of Wireless Savety

Any attack against access control is going seek to steal credentials, or impersonate a user or system with the intention of gaining access and performing unauthorized or outright malicious activities. It is because access control is a common target of attack that organizations must implement strong and proper controls.

On wireless networks, access control can take a number of different forms, each of which can be used independently on their own or can be deployed together to form a more robust solution. Some of the examples of access control mechanisms used in wireless are:

    MAC filtering: This is a process where MAC addresses are entered into an access point, with the intention of allowing or disallowing access by devices holding these MAC addresses.
    Cloaking SSIDs: This technique is used by a network administrator to stop the broadcast of the network identifier out in the open.
    Location of access points: Network owners may choose to place their access point in a place where broadcasts are limited to a certain geographic area within a building. This limits the amount of signal that a malicious party or attacking party gets access to.

This is just a short list of potential measures that can be done for access control to limit the accessibility of a wireless network to just authorized parties.",YELLOW,Introduction Penetration tests
